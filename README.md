# strangerthings-website
A project using light and dark themes with some interesting features. This website is in portuguese due to the content I have worked with, but as It is just a demo for study knowledge, this is not a problem at all. 

I have finished the html, css and little js project. This project is also working with firebase to add the form some sense, but I'm not doing it, since I'm focused on another backend project that I'd like to have focus on.
